== DESCRIPTION ==
= About =
This is a very simple plugin to add meta description in the header of your WordPress website.

Search engines such as Google and Bing use the meta description in their search results.

You can set a custom post or page excerpt that will be used as meta description for that post or page.

This plugin supports the required Open Graph and Twitter Cards tags.

= How to use =
After installation go to Settings > Meta Description and enter a meta description of max. 160 characters. 

If no meta description is entered the tagline will be used.

= Extra settings =
* Use the meta description for homepage only
* Use the custom post and page excerpt as meta description
* Activate and set Open Graph tags
* Activate and set Twitter Cards tags

= Post and page excerpt =
An excerpt is a summary of your post or page content.

The excerpt is already available for posts and with this plugin it becomes available for pages as well.

While adding a post or page you can set an excerpt using the custom excerpt box. 

The custom excerpt will be used as meta description for that post or page.

= Open Graph =
Open Graph offers a sharing integration between your website and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.

This plugin supports the required Open Graph tags.

* site_name = site title
* type = type of page: "website" (default), "article" (post) or "product"
* title = post or page title (and in case of frontpage, homepage or archivepage: site title)
* url = post or page URL (and in case of frontpage, homepage or archivepage: homepage URL)
* description = meta description, tagline (if no meta description is set) or custom excerpt (if set)
* image = featured image or a default image (if set)

= Twitter Cards =
With Twitter Cards you can attach page or post content to tweets, helping to drive traffic to your website.

This plugin supports the required Twitter Cards tags.

* card = type of content: "summary"
* site = your Twitter username

Twitter Cards uses Open Graph tags. This means that Open Graph should be activated too.

= WooCommerce =
This plugin also supports post type "products" which is used by WooCommerce (and other e-commerce plugins).

This means that the custom product excerpt (short description) will be used as meta description for that product.

Enjoy!


== INSTALLATION ==
Installation info is moved to Description section because of the new plugin directory.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why did you set the max. amount on 160 characters? =
Otherwise your meta description might not be fully displayed in search results.

= Why use meta description for homepage only? =
Using the same meta description for all posts and pages is not SEO friendly.

Search engines always index your homepage, because this is a very important page.

= What is a custom excerpt? =
You can find more info about this at the Description section.

= Why no custom excerpt box while adding a post or page? =
If these boxes are not present, they might be unchecked in Screen Options.

= What do you mean with tagline? =
This is the slogan or short description of your site. You can set this in Settings > General.

= What is Open Graph? =
You can find more info about this at the Description section.

= What is Twitter Cards? =
You can find more info about this at the Description section.

= Can I use this plugin with other SEO plugins? =
You should not use a plugin or theme that contains a meta description, Open Graph or Twitter Cards feature. This might cause a conflict.

Or at least do not activate those features in that plugin or theme.

= How can I make a donation? =
You like my plugin and you're willing to make a donation? Nice! There's a PayPal donate link on the WordPress plugin page and my website.
